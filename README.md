# ü™Å Kite

A Kotlin [Gemini][1] server powered by Netty,

It works - which is more than I expected, given how little time I invested.

[ExampleServer][2] provides a first look at generating sites from Kotlin.

## open TODOs

- [ ] support hosts other than localhost
- [ ] serve real files too (index.gmi! directory restrictions! mime types!)
- [ ] certificate management (hostnames! expiry!)
