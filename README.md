# ü™Å Kite

A Kotlin [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) server powered by Netty.

It works - which is more than I expected, given how little time I invested.

[ExampleServer](kite-example/src/main/kotlin/low/orbit/kite/example/ExampleServer.kt)
provides a first look at generating sites from Kotlin.

## open TODOs

- [ ] support hosts other than localhost
- [ ] serve real files too (index.gmi! directory restrictions! mime types!)
- [ ] certificate management (hostnames! expiry!)
- [ ] tests
